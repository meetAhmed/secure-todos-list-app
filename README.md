# Secure Todo App

A simple, secure and offline Todo application built using React Native CLI (bare). 
<br><br>I used React Navigation, Redux Toolkit, SQLite for persistent storage, and Expo Local Authentication.
I also wrote unit tests using Jest.

All the core logic is inside the 'src' folder in the project.
